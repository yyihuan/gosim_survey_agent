"""Entry point for the python-agent example (participant-agent-protocol-v4).

Reads one JSON object per line on stdin, writes one JSON object per line on
stdout, logs only to stderr. The loop itself is deliberately thin: all the
decision-making lives in agent_core/ (protocol I/O, state tracking, geometry,
scoring, planning, the LLM client, memory/log, action validation) so this file
stays a readable map of "what happens for each message type".

Before reading anything from stdin, the process checks for an API key (see
agent_core/llm_client.py) and exits right away if none is configured, since
this example's planner uses an LLM for part of its per-night planning. See the
README for configuration details.

  initialize        -> build SurveyState + Planner from the public payload
  decision_request   -> Planner.decide(), validated, sent back as decision_response
  finish              -> Planner.on_finish() logs a summary and the process exits

Any planner exception is caught here and replaced with a safe fallback action --
a bug in the strategy must never end the run as agent_error or hang the process.
