# Competition format: what the platform implements

The participant UI presents one current competition, selected by the administrator.
The single `/compete` workspace replaces the former submission and project pages;
old links redirect there. Its workflow follows the configured phase, project
versions and evaluation batches. A prominent Submit button links to that workspace.

## Current policy (2026-09-27)

| | Practice | Formal competition after the administrator switches |
|---|---|---|
| Entry | `/compete` | `/compete` |
| Input | locally generated `decisions.csv` (50 per team per day); or a complete project on the separate `practice-projects` board (5 evaluations per team per day, 18000 s per scenario) | complete repository or private project ZIP; no CSV; 10 batches per team per day, 3600 s per scenario |
| Execution | participant computer, original scorer | approved project version, platform-controlled sequential observations |
| Scenario | existing public scenarios; the complete-project board runs `dev-fortnight` and `dev-reference` | three fixed formal scenarios (`formal-a`, `formal-b`, `formal-c`), one template for every team, no calibration, files and weather never published; plus one hidden final scenario (`eval-final`) in the sealed phase `final-hidden` |
| Ranking | best score per scenario, unchanged | online board: best complete batch, mean over the three scenarios (live feedback only). Final ranking: the hidden-scenario score of each team's final version only |
| Model | optional; complete-project board: team's own key only | participant supplies API and quota, no organizer credits; award eligibility needs LLM-driven agent techniques in at least two of six stages (judged mainly by Claude reading the final version's code, `scripts/review-agent-usage.py`) |
| Personal credentials | never include in results | HTTPS only; team's choice: kept only in the open page (relay, default) or saved encrypted on the server (opt-in, deleted after the hidden final results are published); teams that call a model must switch to saved before `online` ends |

Formal evaluation accepts a decision only for its current sequence, records it,
then publishes the next observation. Immutable decisions support independent
scoring. CSV remains an exported result artifact, not a formal submission format.

The formal phase (`online`) runs Beijing time 10-05 00:00 to 10-07 23:59; its scenario list stays hidden until then.
Its scenarios keep `weather_public`/`forecasts_public`/`events_public` false, so their files stay private throughout
(migration 20260927000800 would only open a formal scenario whose three flags are all true).

Final version and hidden final (organizer decision 2026-09-26, migration 20260927000800):

- During `online` a team member marks one approved, not withdrawn version as the team's final version
  (`observer_set_final_version`, Participate → "Final version"); changeable until `online.ends_at`, locked after.
  Without a choice the version of the team's best scored `online` batch is used. Organizers see every team's
  choice in Admin → Teams → "Final versions" (`observer_admin_final_versions`).
- The hidden phase `final-hidden` is sealed (`observer_phase_settings.sealed`): until its `leaderboard_mode` is
  `published`, participants cannot see the phase, its scenario, its batches/runs/logs or result downloads, and no
  signed-in user can start an evaluation there. Its scenario files stay private even after publication, and its
  scenario cannot be linked to any other phase.
- After `online` ends, `scripts/run-hidden-final.py` (dry run by default, `--apply`, `--limit`, `--team`,
  `--retry-failed`, `--status`, `--results`) creates one formal batch per team for its final version, outside the
  daily limit: one run per hidden card (E–H); the normal dispatcher runs them. Only batches on the phase's current
  card set count; `--retry-failed` reruns platform failures only (migration 20261001000200). Procedure, estimates
  and confidentiality: `docs/hidden-final-runbook.md`. Publish by setting
  `final-hidden.leaderboard_mode='published'`.
- Model keys (organizer rule 2026-09-27): teams whose program calls a model must switch to stored mode
  ("加密保存" / "Save encrypted on the server") before `online.ends_at`; in relay mode the key lives only in an
  open team page, so hidden-run model calls fail. Participate warns relay teams next to the final version and in
  the model API section; the script flags them. Stored keys are purged automatically
  (`private.observer_auto_purge_provider_keys`, hourly) only once `final-hidden` is published and the retention
  period (7 days) after the latest ends_at of every key-using phase has passed (migration 20260927001200); the
  online ends_at never triggers it on its own. Production data: `drafts/hidden-final-data.sql` (outside the repo).
Before that, including the October 2–3 trainings, teams rehearse the formal flow on Practice
complete-project board (`scripts/configure-observer-practice-projects.py`), which never uses formal scenarios.

See `randomized-evaluation.md` for calibration (now used only by internal acceptance phases) and
`model-api-keys.md` for the personal API flow. Existing scores and
submissions are not deleted or rewritten by the migration.

## The coverage term

A score that only adds up per-tile science is indifferent to where the tiles come from: once scarcity forces an
agent to skip work, it can abandon whole regions for free. `challenge-score-v3` therefore gained one additive term:

```
coverage_bonus = coverage_bonus_weight × base_science_score × coverage_evenness
```

`coverage_evenness` is Jain's fairness index over the per-region counts of completed tiles — 1.0 when finished
tiles spread evenly across the eight regions, 1/8 when one region took everything, 0 when nothing was observed.
The weight lives in each scenario's `score_config.json` and defaults to 0, so scenarios that never set it are
unaffected by the term. The formal scenarios (`formal-a/b/c`) set it at 0.35 — there the term is worth roughly a fifth of
a competitive run's total, and measured strategy differences reach ~2% of total, twenty times the ±0.1% spread
the challenge produced without it.

## The anomaly release (protocol v2 / snapshot v3 / weather v2)

The mechanics are **per scenario**, gated by the anomaly sections of `score_config.json`: the
online-competition scenarios (and the kit's `finals-preview`) enable them, while every practice scenario
keeps the pre-anomaly contract byte for byte — same snapshots, same scores, and previously uploaded v1
agent packages keep running there unchanged. On the enabled scenarios the contract adds the
anomaly-detection game on top of the survey:

- **Efficiency jitter + instrument faults.** Baseline `instrument_efficiency` is drawn per slot in [0.90, 1.00]
  and frozen at generation. One `instrument_fault` event per scenario (region-scoped, efficiency multiplier down
  to 0.10) starts mid-survey and has no natural lifetime (`persists_until_survey_end`): it ends only when a
  correct agent report completes the repair clock. Faults are never forecast and never appear in agent
  snapshots; they only act on the scorer's effective weather.
- **Hidden tile tags.** `outputs/reference/tile_anomalies.csv` (generated from `tile_config.json`
  `anomaly_tags` counts) marks tiles `nova` (score ×1.5) or `reddening` (×0.8, stacking). The multipliers are
  published in `score_config.json`; the tagged tiles are hidden from snapshots only — the truth file ships with
  practice scenarios and stays auditable.
- **Realized-score feedback.** Every snapshot carries `tile_last_finished: {tile_id, score} | null` — the
  realized official score of the most recently finished exposure (interrupted exposures report 0). Snapshot
  weather never carries `instrument_efficiency` and the preview baseline is efficiency-free, so comparing the
  two isolates the hidden instrument side (jitter × fault multiplier × tag multiplier).
- **Report channel.** `decision_response` accepts an optional `reports` array (`Instrument_Failure`, or
  `NOVA` / `Reddening` with a `tile_id`). Reports cost no slot time. Malformed entries are dropped without
  killing the action; duplicates are tolerated. Tags settle at final scoring: first report per (tile, tag),
  +100 correct / −150 wrong (`reporting` section of `score_config.json`). Fault reports drive an in-run
  lifecycle: a correct report (an unacknowledged fault active) publishes `fault_status` after
  `fault_response.response_latency_days` (1 d) at night starts and completes the repair after
  `repair_duration_days` (2 d), which truncates the fault's multiplier; a report with no active fault is a
  misreport — one free per correct report (`fault_misreport_free_allowance`), then `fault_misreport_penalty`
  (100) each, counter resetting on every correct report; re-reporting an acknowledged fault under repair is
  neutral. Misreports get a one-night `"status":"normal"` answer on the same latency schedule.
- **Repeat observations.** `duplicate_tile` is gone: re-observation is legal and a tile's science score is the
  maximum over its observations; completion, REQUIRED-miss relief and flexible quotas still bank on the first
  legal observation; request visits decouple from tile scores (a request on a previously observed tile needs a
  new post-issue observation to count a visit). `avoidable_wait` counts a wait as avoidable when an unfinished
  tile could complete or a repeat could beat the tile's banked best.
- **Audit chain.** Accepted reports are flattened into `decisions.csv` as `report_instrument_failure` /
  `report_nova` / `report_reddening` action rows (sharing the incrementing `decision_id` sequence), so the
  single trace file replays everything and its SHA-256 covers reports too. The practice baseline anchor
  is `12287.478365` on `dev-reference` (test constant `BASELINE_TOTAL`, starter-kit README, SKILL.md).

Calibration knobs: `score_config.json` sections `repeat_observation` / `reporting` / `anomaly_tags` /
`fault_response`; `weather_config.json` `quality.instrument_efficiency.jitter_minimum/maximum` and
`events.instrument_fault` (including its `instrument_efficiency_multiplier_range`); `tile_config.json` `anomaly_tags`; the reference agent's detection thresholds are
the `SAC_ANOMALY_*` environment variables documented in `agent/anomaly_detection.py`.

## Where each piece lives

| Concern | Code |
|---|---|
| Submission kind (`results` \| `agent`) | `public.submission_kind` enum, `supabase/migrations/20260909000100_core.sql` |
| Which kinds a phase accepts | `phases.allow_results` / `phases.allow_agents`, enforced in the `create_submission` RPC |
| Which scenarios a phase uses | `phase_scenarios`, seeded in `worker/main.py` (`DEFAULT_SCENARIOS`, `seed()`) |
| Per-file visibility of a scenario | `scenarios.weather_public` / `forecasts_public` / `events_public`; enforced when the scenario is published to storage |
| Results-file evaluation | `worker/main.py` `evaluate()`, `kind == "results"` branch: the upload becomes `decisions.csv` and goes straight to the scorer |
| Hosted agent run | `worker/challenge_runner.py` via `evaluate()`, `kind == "agent"`: per-run venv, scrubbed environment, rlimits, one global wall clock, process-group kill at the cutoff |
| Agent transport | `challenge/run_challenge.py` (`JsonLineAgentProcess`), protocol `participant-agent-protocol-v2` |
| Scoring | `challenge/scoring_core.py`, the science team's scorer plus one additive coverage-uniformity term (off by default); weights in `scoring/score_config.json` |
| Replay visualization | `challenge/replay.py` + `challenge/templates/decision_replay.html`; produced for both kinds and uploaded as `decision_replay.html` |
| Local equivalent of the hosted run | `archive/starter_kit_v3/local_runner.py` — same transport, same environment rules, same scorer |

## Scenario generation

All scenarios come from one generator, `challenge/scenario_builder.py`, driven by the tile, weather, calendar and
request simulators delivered by the science team. A scenario is a directory of `config/*.json` plus
`outputs/reference/*.csv`, checksummed and validated by the authoritative scorer before it is registered.

```bash
# public practice scenario, everything downloadable
python -m worker.main gen-scenario --slug demo-week --seed 20261005 --days 7 --start-date 2026-10-05 --wallclock 900

# competition scenario, weather and forecasts withheld
python -m worker.main gen-scenario --slug eval-c --seed 777 --days 30 --start-date 2026-10-05 --wallclock 3600 \
  --hidden-weather --hidden-forecasts --regions 8 --tiles-per-region 200 --coverage-weight 0.35
```

Hidden scenarios should use a large seed (e.g. `secrets.randbits(128)`) and the opt-in hashed seed derivation
(`python -m challenge.scenario_builder generate ... --seed-derivation sha256-v1`, or `seed_derivation="sha256-v1"`):
every simulator stream (tiles, tile tags, weather slots/events/forecasts, requests) is then seeded with the first
16 bytes of `sha256("<seed>:<stream>")` instead of `seed + offset`, so the RNG output published in the tile catalogue
reveals nothing about the weather or tag streams. The mode is recorded in the scenario, weather and request configs, the catalogue metadata and
`scenario_manifest.json`; without it generation is byte-identical to before.

The `demo-week` parameters above are the same ones that produced `archive/starter_kit_v3/scenarios/demo-week`, so the copy in
the downloaded kit and the copy the platform publishes are the same scenario.

## Open operational items

These are decisions for the organizers, not code changes:

- Do not rotate the seeds of `formal-a` / `formal-b` / `formal-c` / `eval-final` once the competition has started: every
  team is scored on the same template, and rotating would change the scenario mid-competition. Internal acceptance
  phases that keep calibration rows still refuse a formal run without a calibrated instance.
- Practice-phase `results` uploads are a bare `decisions.csv` — which now also carries any `report_*` rows, so
  practice scoring settles reports exactly like hosted runs.
- Decide how many worker runners to keep alive during the online phase. A 1–2 h wall clock per scenario means one
  runner serialises submissions.
